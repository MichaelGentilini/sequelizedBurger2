The burger model has all CRUD functions

- Create - when the user types in a burger name and presses the "Add a Burger" button a new burger is created.
- Read - when the user goes to the URL the pre-existing "Available Burgers" are read from the MYSQL database.
- Update - when the user clicks eat it button, the devoured value is updated and the burger to the "Eaten Burgers" column.
- Delete - when the user clicks the delete button, the burger is deleted from the MYSQL database.
